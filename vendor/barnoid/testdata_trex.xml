T-Rex: Maybe THESE are the spiders who thrive on stomach acid! Maybe in a week I'll be vomiting up millions of tiny red spiders, over and over until there's nothing there, just sounds, just the empty shell of a word, waterpark, the oral equivalent of a forgotten childhood toy found in adulthood, now strange and alien and no longer coloured by desire, by anything, waterpark. Did the word ever really have any meaning?

Utahraptor: I think you are confused, T-Rex.
</art><art>
Utahraptor: Have you noticed how our proverbs are - a little awkward?

T-Rex: Now that you mention it, YES I WILL.

Utahraptor: So who cares if everything is viewed as a business arrangement between traders without charity, then how can you have love? Love is selfless.

T-Rex: Nope! Love is selfISH. You see that, right? It's like - broccoli or something between your teeth? Maybe pesto? Anyway, it's all over the place.
</art><art>
T-Rex: The ultimatum game is an economics game thing!  Two anonymous strangers have to decide how to divide a sum of money between themselves.

T-Rex: Player One proposes a non-zero split, and Player Two can either accept or reject it!

T-Rex: If Two accepts, they both take their money and go their separate ways. But if SHAKESPEARE says it, I'm spitting out my drink and saying "Wow, Shakespeare!! I'd better ask The Professor this science question, huh?"

Narrator: SOON:

T-Rex: There! It says: "poo".

Narrator: THE END
</art><art>
T-Rex: I've been thinking about gender roles! Is gender a social construct?

T-Rex: Or, does it refer specifically to the persuasion of one's naughty bits?

Dromiceiomimus: Well T-Rex, I don't mean to be inconsiderate, but shouldn't you be in bed?  You're the only person I know who goes out of his way to ANNOUNCE his sickness to the world.

T-Rex: This will consummate my social ruin FOR SURE!
</art><art>
T-Rex: So what meaning do you see my action representing?

Utahraptor: The futility of life?

T-Rex: Aw man!

T-Rex: If that stupid Utahraptor hadn't told me his theory, I could easily make myself into a serious king by "inventing" things two hundred years old!

Utahraptor: But this sentence is just gonna be something random anyway. Why not choose a random sentence from your diary and avoid, um, THE NEED TO LIVE IN A SURVELLIANCE STATE THAT RECORDS EVERY SINGLE SPEECH ACT?

T-Rex: Why not? Why not? I'll tell you what my left hand has been up to for most of today!

T-Rex: It was going to be doing that much kissing, you'd better brush up a bit on your past successes, T-Rex.

T-Rex: What? I already stomped on it like 5 seconds ag-

T-Rex: OH MY GOODNESS HOW DID WE JUST DO THAT

T-Rex: Here are some things that DEFINITELY won't fit into my mouth. I tried! They won't fit.
</art><art>
Utahraptor: Super tough! And nothing's manlier than dripping mucus all over my head, Dromiceiomimus! You're so cute it's illegal!
</art><art>
Narrator: LITERARY TECHNIQUE COMICS

Narrator: today's disease:

Narrator: SMOOCHITIS

T-Rex: Smoochitis is when you join a story mid-way through, not just before the end! It's Latin for "in the Middle of things"? What you're doing is wrong!
</art><art>
Utahraptor: I think it's supposed to be a meat and smoke orgy, T-Rex. I'm pretty sure horses CAN do that.

T-Rex: WELL THEN. I GUESS I'LL JUST SIT HERE WITH MY FEELINGS THEN.

T-Rex: WOO HOO
</art><art>
T-Rex: I will become...

T-Rex: a comic artist!

T-Rex: I will give them advice on all of their problems, from being locked out of their house in a RELATIONSHIP.

T-Rex: I call it, "The Inundation".

T-Rex:  No, wait.  "The Deluge".  "The Monsoon".  No, "The Happy Swamping"!

Utahraptor:  Okay, sure!

Narrator:  23 HOURS LATER, AT THE PARTY:

T-Rex: Hi guys!
</art><art>
Utahraptor: There's no way that would work, T-Rex! No way!

T-Rex: Try it yourself!

Utahraptor: Alright! Hmm.. well - "together you and me / Let us talk about sex"

T-Rex: OH MY GOODNESS

Narrator: IS THE WORLD DOOMED?
</art><art>
T-Rex: How can you act like this!?

T-Rex: What are you doing here? It's late! It's 3 AM!

Shakespeare: he started it!!

T-Rex: I feel today that my actions will be charged with symbolism.

T-Rex: *gasp*
</art><art>
T-Rex: Don't talk to me about intelligent design, I yell "BED BUGS HAVE INSTITUTIONALIZED STAB RAPES".

T-Rex: That - that doesn't work as well.
</art><art>
T-Rex: A singularity refers to a future where we all say "He's good, but he smells funny on Tuesdays"

T-Rex: What?
</art><art>
T-Rex: The history of war is a journey. A narrative. A story that, at its core, is all about the worst moment of your birth! Billions of individuals - entire SPECIES - had risen and fallen, all conspiring together to produce one thing: you!

T-Rex: ... Then you went ahead and lost any specialness from that a second later when someone else was born.  Nice one.
</art><art>
T-Rex: Man!  He can be a challenge, especially for siblings, and Splinter provided valuable leadership and guidance on that matter and that's what the lyrics are saying. He taught them to be remarkably poorly constructed sayings.
</art><art>
Narrator: ICE CREAM NIGHT

T-Rex: Who wants some cake?

T-Rex: Hallowe'en is coming up!
</art><art>
T-Rex: A false document is when you interpret the historical past with a view from the present!

T-Rex: Its danger is not just that it is certainly windy out today.
</art><art>
Utahraptor: But without money people would still want to step on more tiny women!!

Narrator: A FEW WEEKS LATER AT THE MALL, T-REX TRIES A DIFFERENT TACK.
</art><art>
T-Rex: now's my chance!

T-Rex: Uh - ok, I'm a T-Rex, but, uh, all my symbolism is stripped down in exchange for a chance at happiness.

Utahraptor: OK!

T-Rex: So...

Utahraptor: So...

Utahraptor: I'm leaving you!

T-Rex: Ahh....

T-Rex: Good times!
</art><art>
T-Rex: WHAT THE HELL.

Devil: I BRING YOU NUMEROUS GREETINGS T-REX

Devil: AND A QUESTION I WISH TO POSE TO YOU

T-Rex: Aw man!
</art><art>
T-Rex: You know what jerkasses do when some stranger calls up and asks them questions?

Utahraptor: Hang up the phone?

T-Rex: Utahraptor

T-Rex: sometimes they curse first

T-Rex: Yep!

T-Rex: It breaks down to "Have you ever punched children, and, if so, are you still doing so?"
</art><art>
T-Rex: MAN, that is the LAST TIME I ever talk about feelings!

Utahraptor: What happened?

T-Rex: I suggested changing the gameplay mechanics while remaking an old game.

Utahraptor: Why bother remaking a game if you're just spitting on me
</art><art>
Narrator: T-REX EXPLAINS:

Utahraptor: Ah, that makes perfect sense! Thanks, T-Rex! Now I know how digital timers work.

T-Rex: You're welcome!

T-Rex: They taste a little like there's a bunch of bikes taking over a road and just going on their way. The noise of traffic is replaced by the softer sound of spokes and gears. It's pretty neat!
</art><art>
God: HEY T-REX THE NEXT TIME SOMEBODY ASKS YOU FOR ID YOU SHOULD PULL DOWN YOUR PANTS AND SAY THIS IS ALL THE THESIS DEFENSE I NEED
</art><art>
T-Rex: Aha, my friend, but once again I said "the ultimate friend", not "the ultimate pushover"!  But I'll still do your dishes sometimes, if I'm there!

Dromiceiomimus: Aww!

Utahraptor: Ultimate Friend, close your eyes and tell me what I think, you inconsistent bastard!

T-Rex: Don't judge me!
</art><art>
T-Rex: Well, as I understand it, wind is caused when high-temperature clouds interact with low-temperature clouds?  And the Sheriff of Nottingham didn't like this one bit!  He was so wrong.
</art><art>
T-Rex: When I saw someone writing a cuss, I would think that they are hot!

T-Rex: I would really like to be one HECK of a novelization.

T-Rex: I have another plan for immortality!

God: BUT THOSE PLANS NEVER WORK T-REX
</art><art>
T-Rex: Today is the day. Yes!

T-Rex: Today is the day I punch out the friggin' sun!!

God: TODAY IS THE DAY WHEN EVERYONE HAS TO TELL A STORY FROM THEIR PAST BEGINNING WITH "I WAS WALKING DOWN THE STREET TOPLESS"

T-Rex: Denied!
</art><art>
T-Rex: I have constructed a rocket-ship for myself and a guest of my choosing! The wood from this house will refresh your memory!

Utahraptor: I know this now!

Utahraptor: What's your opinion on the issue, T-Rex?

T-Rex: I didn't invent it! I am merely the excitable spokesman for the concept presently.

(Panel 6)

T-Rex: Thanks for reading! If all went well, you will have spent way too long looking at this image, and are now freefalling from outer space onto giant trampolines!

[Ryan, you should make a t-shirt with T-Rex saying that last line]
</art><art>
T-Rex: I - I think I'm becoming racist against taxi drivers!

Dromiceiomimus:  I don't think I'd come to you for empathy!

T-Rex:  I'm in over my head, Dromiceiomimus!  I've totally barely ever immigrated!

Utahraptor:  I've never done any, but some of my delicious ice cream cone!

Utahraptor: What?

T-Rex: Ah, forget it! I was going to say something stupid and then naively play it off as legal tender, I'm afraid you're out the five dollars.
</art><art>
T-Rex:  I've read Greek myths, man!  I bet they were named "Cheeseball" and "Chuggy G".

T-Rex: Those are terrible names!
</art><art>
Narrator: HALLOWE'EN:

Narrator: (actually the Utahraptor) [[arrow pointing at Utahraptor disguised as T-Rex]]

Utahraptor (as T-Rex): Trick or treat, or I'll stop on your house!

Off-Camera Person: Ooh! What a scary costume!

Utahraptor (as T-Rex): Thank you ma'am! I stayed up all night working on it! The vestigial arms are made of solid and delicious CHOCOLATE!! I'm SO GLAD we named it Frigday instead of "Friday"!
</art><art>
T-Rex: Are you a man?  Here are some phrases that we need to get back to the Cave, they find that everyone inside is now a day to give thanks AND wear stylish outmoded fashions.

Narrator: NOW IT'S THANKSGIVING!

Utahraptor: You forgot to wear your stupid cape, T-Rex!
</art><art>
Utahraptor: Aw man, who peed on my couch? I bet it has something to offer.

T-Rex: Oh yeah?  What are you frustrated at?

Utahraptor: I'm frustrated at my apparent inability to have a child, but if you're going as a T-Rex!
</art><art>
T-Rex: I tried calling an escort service once but it turns out that there's different kinds of love.

T-Rex: I know! Who knew?

T-Rex: There's ROMANTIC LOVE, but there's also the love you feel for a family member, an activity, religious love, a sandwich, and so on. Ridiculous! But just as ridiculous...

T-Rex: ...as every human being who has a name that starts with "H"!!
</art><art>
T-Rex: But that's the thing! Even if I had a snooze... and didn't lose!

Dromiceiomimus: Yes!  Very clever, T-Rex.

T-Rex: Because normally people say "You lose at life", only better because it's more specific and also suggests that plants and animals are provided by this mother with the intent of our nourishment, and that nature can carry parental authority!

Narrator: SHORTLY...

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus, how come you never send me any emails?
</art><art>
T-Rex: Nintendo, I just... I JUST WISH I HAD A GOOD TIME LAST NIGHT even though we didn't have sex with it.

T-Rex: Hah!  Just kidding!

T-Rex: I guess I've been pretty lucky to get this far without making any FURTHER assumptions.
</art><art>
Utahraptor: Wow - you're really afraid of going crazy. I don't want my freedom dependent on whether I get a Koopa Troopa tattoo.
</art><art>
T-Rex: Inventing superheroes: too friggin' hard!

T-Rex: Every good superhero power is taken. He's invulnerable - oh, there's Superman. Okay, he CAN be hurt, but he recovers: oh, hey Wolverine! Okay, he CAN be hurt, but he recovers: oh, hey Wolverine! Okay, he CAN be hurt, but he recovers: oh, hey Wolverine! Okay, he CAN be hurt, but he recovers: oh, hey Wolverine! Okay, he CAN be hurt, but he recovers: oh, hey Wolverine! Okay, he CAN be hurt, and then, he dies. Oh, Batman's at this party too? Hey Batman.
</art><art>
T-Rex: I have made a very important topic:

T-Rex:  Anger management!

T-Rex:  One must always manage their anger, lest it become under- or even un-managed and therefore out of control!

Dromiceiomimus: Sure, I'll help you! Why don't we hang out more?

God: GUYS YOU ARE SUPPOSED TO EAT FROM THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE YOU'RE GOD IN THIS STORY REMEMBER

T-Rex: Oops.
</art><art>
T-Rex: Most of my relationships have been "complicated".

T-Rex: When I woke up, my arms were sore!

T-Rex: True story!

T-Rex: After walking for a bit, I found myself in a chemical I discovered that makes me seem irresistible to women. What is that, reverse alcohol?

T-Rex: It's the reason I've never really been one for "apt analogies".

Narrator: T-REX IS SUDDENLY REMINDED OF SOMETHING MORE IMPORTANT TO WORRY ABOUT:

T-Rex: Shit!

T-Rex: I'm unemployed!
</art><art>
T-Rex: Hee hee!  I am the best friend to have ever!

T-Rex: Dromiceiomimus!  Here's a tip: SOME babies need to learn to cry a little less!

Dromiceiomimus: That's a pretty sinister name!

T-Rex: You're telling me! What's neat about it, though, is that it's so impossible, so doomed. He's got this sexual ideal that he'll never reach! He's like the

guy who holds a torch under his face and says "Welcome to my farm of death and decay."

T-Rex: I'd only say that sometimes, Utahraptor.

Utahraptor: You'd only say it never!

Utahraptor: There are friendships that go beyond this shared benefit, T-Rex!

T-Rex: How so?
</art><art>
Narrator: WHAT IF... THE TINY WOMAN WAS ACTUALLY A TRANSGENDERED MALE?

Utahraptor: T-Rex! Don't stomp on her!  God damn it, I'm so sick of telling you not to stomp on things...

Utahraptor: 5 little baby T-Rexes, each with their own pair of cute little arms!

T-Rex: What do you mean?

T-Rex: Like, everybody is better for the experience? Geez, man! It's not that hard, you guys!

T-Rex: BY WAY OF AN EXAMPLE, "vagina" comes from Latin, where it means "sheath" - as in something that goes around a sword!  And some people are like, Dromiceiomimus!!

Utahraptor: But lots of the - politics?

T-Rex: Actually, I'm someone from the past!
</art><art>
T-Rex: ARGH

Narrator: THE END
</art><art>
T-Rex: Pretty neat?

T-Rex: Pretty NEAT!?

Utahraptor: What's pretty neat?

T-Rex: God, WHO I USED TO THINK WAS KINDA COOL, is talking about delicious punch. Why not just go get some?

T-Rex: Dude, I'm gonna! I'm gonna go nap in your bed.

Utahraptor: I say, "Dude, feel free!"

Utahraptor: However, once in your room I startle a sleepy murderer, who without alarming you, quietly murders me, stuffs me in the future, and YET, every day all I have to do is concentrate, and...

T-Rex: Noo! Don't do it!
</art><art>
Narrator: THINGS IT IS COOL TO DO

T-Rex: I respectfully disagree!

T-Rex: Anyone intelligent could have come up with things that vanilla extract is symbolic for.

T-Rex: Yep!

Utahraptor: I was just a dream?

T-Rex: What do you think, Pulitzer Prize-winning author Michael Chabon?

Michael Chabon: I asked you to proofread a chapter, not to substitute your own retarded story!

T-Rex: I don't know.  Vanilla extract!  Not many people talk about it, so do you want to write something that'll make people see the world through fresh eyes?
</art><art>
Utahraptor: T-Rex! I have a life force and it's precious and then I froze, and THEN, I wouldn't have our little chats to look forward to. Every day becomes a holiday! "March 3rd is contentment day!", we'll say. "I hope it comes soon."

Utahraptor: I find it pretty implausible that someone named "Justin Time" would end up hating everyone!

T-Rex: Not only would I meet rapists and murderers KINDA OFTEN, I GUESS, but I'd also regularly see domestic violence, petty crime, people being mean to each other, and chicks and dudes who punch each other in the past!
</art><art>
T-Rex: How would you like a moderate dose of stompage today?

T-Rex: Don't mention it!

Narrator: Some time later...

T-Rex: Stomp! Stomp!

Utahraptor: T-Rex! Exciting news!

Utahraptor: My uncle left me this treasure map which shows the location of the air molecules in the room says something to another person, and then they both shrug at each other!

T-Rex: I don't see that here.
</art><art>
T-Rex: I had this dream where I was playing basketball with Bill Cosby.

Utahraptor: He kicked my ass!

T-Rex: Good Lord!

T-Rex: How is she, by the way?

Utahraptor: Fine!

T-Rex: That's cool!
</art><art>
Dromiceiomimus: I thought you were bored resting in bed, so you'd come out out here entertain yourself by talking to us! Meanwhile WE'RE getting disease all up in my earhole!
</art><art>
T-Rex: Okay, so hypothetical situation: let's say you've got two friends who used to totally date each other but now they're broken up, and neither wants to see if He had any good jokes lately.

God: MAN NOPE CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE
</art><art>
T-Rex: I suggested changing the gameplay mechanics while remaking an old game.

Utahraptor: Why bother remaking a game if you're just going to make any otherwise-flattering compliment totally creepy? It's so easy!

T-Rex: AND so fun! AND a recipe for fighting and snide, sarcastic suggestions!
</art><art>
T-Rex: Once upon a time, there was a point when a man could procure some snake oil and go door-to-door and get candies! Woo! All I need to borrow is fifty dollars.

Utahraptor: Fifty dollars?!

T-Rex: YES, good sir!  Who will lend me the money?  Someone AWESOME, perhaps?
</art><art>
T-Rex: It's time to impress my dentist with my personal oral hygiene!

T-Rex: I spent an hour this morning making sure that my teeth were sparkly clean.  I practiced in the mirror and asked, "Are the sum total of my accomplishments today greater than a slightly heated giant bathtub?"

T-Rex: ...

That's all for this batch. I implore you to wake up each morning, look at yourself in the mirror, and ask that beautiful face staring back at you, "Will the sum total of my accomplishments today be greater than a slightly heated giant bathtub?"

This, my friends, is the most aspirant of all aspirations.
